# Spring-Framework-Essentials-Lab
This repository contains my solutions and implementations for selected labs from Spring Academy courses (e.g. Building a REST API with Spring Boot). Each module in the original course contains TODO markers that indicate the lab tasks; I completed those tasks locally in IntelliJ.
