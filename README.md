# Spring Framework Essentials Lab

**Project:** Personal implementations of Spring Academy lab modules

**Summary**
This repository contains *my* solutions and implementations for selected labs from Spring Academy courses (e.g. Building a REST API with Spring Boot). Each module in the original course contains `TODO` markers that indicate the lab tasks; I completed those tasks locally in IntelliJ and ran then=m using IntelliJ (you can use the built in Gradle or Maven wrapper instead).

**What this repo contains**

* My implemented source code for each lab/module (under `module-*/src`), except for `00-rewards-common` and `01-rewards-db`.
* Test fixtures and unit/integration tests I ran locally.
* No instructor solution files are included verbatim.

**Course credit & provenance**
These labs were completed while following Spring Academy course material. Course content, lab instructions, and official solutions belong to Spring Academy. This repo contains my personal work and notes; I credit Spring Academy as the source of the exercises.

**Quick status**

* IDE: IntelliJ IDEA
* Build: Gradle or maven wrapper included
* Tests: All local course/test checks passed for the labs I completed (see individual modules)

**Notes about TODOs**

* Each lab contains `TODO` comments in the original course files that guided implementation. I completed the `TODO` tasks and implemented features accordingly. If you look at the module folders, you’ll see which files I modified.

**License & contact**

* Course materials are © Spring Academy.
